I've created "JavaScript Quest" - a complete game that transforms JavaScript learning into an epic adventure! Here's what makes it special:
🎮 Game Features:

RPG Elements: Level up, gain XP, track health/mana
Epic Storyline: Journey from Village of Variables to Object Observatory
Character Progression: Unlock skills as you master concepts
Interactive Challenges: Real coding exercises with instant feedback

🗺️ Your Adventure Path:

Village of Variables - Learn to declare and use variables
Forest of Functions - Master function creation and parameters
Conditional Caves - Conquer if/else logic
Loop Labyrinth - Harness the power of loops
Array Arsenal - Organize data with arrays
Object Observatory - Master complex data structures

🎯 Game Mechanics:

XP System: Gain 25 XP per completed challenge
Health/Mana: Lose health for wrong answers, use mana for hints

Visual Feedback: Glowing effects, animations, and progress bars

🧙‍♂️ Characters You'll Meet:

The game automatically saves your progress and provides hints when you're stuck. Each challenge builds on the previous one, so you're genuinely learning JavaScript fundamentals while having fun!
